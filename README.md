## 🎯 About

StreamPlayerApp is an open source project based on the Netflix app, all of the features are being implemented by members of our CodandoTV community. The objective is to provide a learning and practical programming experience, serving as a mentoring platform. These are the technologies we are using here:

**Flow, Compose, Koin, NavigationCompose, Arquitetura MVVM com clean architecture entre outras ( ainda será separado um link para isso)**

## 🏋️‍♀️ Goal
This project was initiated with the purpose of providing a hands-on and collaborative learning opportunity for the community. Through it, participants can improve their skills in Android development, Kotlin, clean architecture and teamwork.

## 💬 Communication
We have a specific channel called [#projeto-netflix](https://discord.com/channels/843114243859546142/1101921493010616351)) in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/fZMDmjKmju) server to talk about the project.

## 🗺️ How to use the WIKI (7th tab in our git project)

I hope our wiki becomes richer and richer, so it will be a continuous process. These will be listed, our technologies motivators and more something that we find relevant.

If you realize that something relevant is missing here, please vote and post a PR for the wiki as well!

## 🎤 How to use the Discussions option (4th tab in our git project)

It may be that there are non-discord threads that interrupt and sometimes communicate like in any company there is a mistake, imagine a project that we do in our spared time.

We have a section called `discussions`, this is hosted in our repository, so we keep history. If you want to see an example of [Discussion](https://github.com/CodandoTV/StreamPlayerApp/discussions/48), we can create long threads there, something like `reddit`. Let's see if this approach works for us.
